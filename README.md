# Weatherpage

## Description

For this project I created a webpage that displays the weather for a city that the user searches. I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery and the openweathermap api to create this project. The user can search for a city and when they do they will be shown the current weather for that city as well as the weather for the next five days. The cities that the user searches for are stored in local storage and the user can click a button with the city name on it to redirect them back to the weather for that city.
